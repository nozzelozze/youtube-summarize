Kyle's dogless hooks the hook came right out come on like the gar we have in our pond now that Kyle tagged this sharks we're gonna be able to track how does that work Kyle the waves were a little too loud to hear but because of the fish tagging we can track how fast they're growing and where they're migrating okay this one because it's tagged we're going to go ahead and release it but the next one we catch is going to be food for big owls Jabron gabon's first trip to the beach wow he caught that all by himself oh elegant moment but for the rest of this day this little Fella's just hanging out
